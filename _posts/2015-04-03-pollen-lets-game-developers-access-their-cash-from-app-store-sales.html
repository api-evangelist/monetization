<p>Game developers who have successful mobile titles face a big timing problem.If their game is a hit, they should start spending money to boost it even further through mobile advertising.But the platform owners Google and Apple don’t pay quickly.So Pollen VC is stepping in as a financing company, fronting money to the developers so they can start capitalizing on their success, even as they wait for payments for 30 days or more from the platform owners.It’s a middleman role for London-based Pollen VC, but it’s critical role in modern financial technology.</p>
