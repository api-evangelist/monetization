<p>Among the myriad announcements that Facebook crammed into its hour-long F8 Developer Conference keynote was an update on its video ad monetization scheme.The company announced that LiveRail, its ad tech platform for publishers’ video, will soon support display ads in mobile apps alongside video.The plan was mentioned briefly in the keynote, and augmented in a blog post by LiveRail engineer Mark Edwards.“LiveRail will power native ad formats as well as standard display placements like interstitials and banners.The Audience Network, with its high performing native ad format and access to 2 million Facebook advertisers, is tightly integrated into this platform,” Edwards wrote.</p>
