I am putting a lot of thought into the value of an API request and response lately.Ive talked about the potential of a Postman collection as a unit of measurement, for the API economy.I’m also spending time breaking down the monetization strategies of the 700+ companies I track on, but I’m really looking to get beyond just the API pricing, and actually measure any evidence of real value that I can.This particular post is born out of a conversation with John Sheehan (@johnsheehan), CEO of Runscope, while we were in Sydney Australia last month for API Days Sydney.John had mentioned that when people asked him which are the best APIs out there, he replies “none of them, until they are used”.</p>
