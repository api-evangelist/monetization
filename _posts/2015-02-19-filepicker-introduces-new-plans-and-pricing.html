<p>We’ve been on the phone and email over the past few months talking to customers to find what plan structure makes the most sense.We’ve also done data analysis to see what fits best with most of our customers.With all the feedback we are introducing new plans with higher limits on files and conversions.We’ve also added more clarity around our overages and bandwidth, and outlined them on our pricing page.If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us!</p>
