<p>I am personally committed to openness and transparency regarding our pricing and licensing.When I announced the new Appcelerator Platform last week, I mentioned that I was going to follow-up to provide you with details about the changes that we are making to our Plans &amp; Pricing.As I’ve said before, we care deeply about providing you with outstanding value and high quality products at competitive prices.This has been our commitment from the day Nolan and I started this company.One of our core company values is to “Enable Customer Success,” and we are honored each and every day to empower you to deliver transformative mobile experiences to the world.</p>
