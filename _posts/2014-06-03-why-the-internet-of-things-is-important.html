<p>Here at Aria Systems, we live and breathe all things related to monetization via customer care and relationships.We live in a world where recurring revenue management is becoming a dominant theme.Lately there’s been a natural gravitation to the Internet of Things/Internet of Everything, and the synchronicity between the business models the IoT produces and how Aria is serendipitously designed to support all of it.Simply put, we want people to think a lot about the new age the IoT heralds.To that end, this post is the first in a series intended to explore the monetization of IoT in some depth; in other words, the Monetization of Things.</p>
