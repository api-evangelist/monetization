<p>Bill Gross is like a ghost from the Internet’s past.In the first Internet gold rush, he started Idealab, a dot-com factory of sorts — and he also came up with the idea for paid-search advertising, which eventually turned Google into a cash gusher.Now he wants to do the same on Twitter, and has some ideas about monetizing Twitter streams through his clients.For past few months he has been on a shopping spree through his company UberMedia, and has been buying some of the more popular twitter clients such as UberTwitter and TweetDeck, which now gives him control over about twenty percent of Twitter’s traffic.This seems to have gotten Twitter bent out of shape.</p>
