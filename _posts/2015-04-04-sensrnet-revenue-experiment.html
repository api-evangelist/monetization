<p>At Sensr.net we use Stripe to handle all the credit card charges.Recently I started using Profitwell to try to understand better where we are making money and where we are loosing it.Most of our growth today comes from new users.Wouldnâ€™t it be great if we could convince existing users to spend more?</p>
