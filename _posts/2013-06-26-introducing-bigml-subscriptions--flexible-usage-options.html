<p>It’s been almost a month since we launched our “Spread the Word” program which gives free subscriptions to users who invite three or more friends to use BigML—and we’ve been thrilled with the response and the hundreds of new users that are tapping into the power of machine learning through BigML.We are now giving anyone the option to sign up for a paid subscription to our service (with special introductory pricing) so that you can perform unlimited predictive modeling at different task sizes–this complements the ability to use BigML for free in Development mode, as well as our long-standing pay-as-you-go option.To get started with predictive modeling we encourage users to leverage our free Development mode where you can build models, ensembles and evaluations up to 5MB in size.  Development mode also features inline sources for those of you interested in manually inputting data to simulate specific situations.  Learn more about how to use Development mode option here.</p>
