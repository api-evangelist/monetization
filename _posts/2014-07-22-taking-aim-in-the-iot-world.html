<p>We are at the beginning of another explosion in information applications.This one is being driven by small, intelligent sensors that can precisely measure and communicate stuff like temperature, position, movement, light and chemical traces.These, connectable sensors are reliable, manageable and affordable enough to be within reach of both businesses and consumers.This entire sensor universe (and its associated infrastructure) is referred to as the Internet of Things, or IoT.It is, in essence, a new type of platform with astounding breadth and complexity.</p>
