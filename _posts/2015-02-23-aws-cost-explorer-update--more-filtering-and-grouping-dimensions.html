<p>AWS Cost Explorer is a spend management tool that lets you analyze, visualize and allocate your AWS spend to internal teams or projects.Using Cost Explorer, you can visualize your daily or monthly spend in easy-to-read bar and line charts or simple downloadable data tables.You can also choose to see your spend only for specific service types, linked account and tags and group the spend by both service types and linked accounts.Since the first launch of Cost Explorer in April 2014, thousands of customers have signed up to use Cost Explorer and have provided us with feedback about how easy and convenient it has become to analyze their AWS spend.They have also provided us with many suggestions for further improvements!</p>
