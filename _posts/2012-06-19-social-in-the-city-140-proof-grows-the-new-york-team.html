<p>The biggest city in the world for advertising is also the most social.We’ve been rapidly expanding our New York sales and ad operations team to keep up with brands’ appetite for social campaigns.Plus we just love Manhattan, and Manhattan has been great to 140 Proof.NYC-based brands like UPS, AMC, Victoria’s Secret, Vitamin Water have all trusted 140 Proof’s NYC teams with their social ad strategies.And new 140 Proof New York customers like Svedka, IBM, and ABC have encouraged us to expand our New York footprint as more and more agencies and brands get serious about scaling social campaigns.</p>
