<p>The tracking and ad targeting associated with the gigabit service cannot be avoided using browser privacy settings: as AT&T explained, the program works independently of your browsers privacy settings regarding cookies, do-not-track and private browsing.In other words, AT&T is performing deep packet inspection, a controversial practice through which internet service providers, by virtue of their privileged position, monitor all the internet traffic of their subscribers and collect data on the content of those communications.It would seem the major telecommunications corporations are acting as subordinate government agencies, doing their bidding, (or vice versa).It any case it seems the corporate-military coalition has coalesced to dominate and control not only the individual citizens of the USA, but the entire world.And, we get to pay for the privilege of having our basic human rights denied, or in this case having to buy them back.</p>
