<p>Twitter is changing its prices.On Thursday, the company announced it was introducing new tools for what it calls objective-based campaigns, which include four new ways advertisers can buy ads on the social media platform.Previously, ad buyers worked on a cost-per-engagement model, paying for promoted Tweets only when users interacted with them -- a click, reply, retweet or favorite.Now, advertisers can opt to pay on engagements to capture new followers, conversions to an external website, app-installs or user email addresses.For Twitter, the new model is intended to net more ad dollars and expand its young products.</p>
