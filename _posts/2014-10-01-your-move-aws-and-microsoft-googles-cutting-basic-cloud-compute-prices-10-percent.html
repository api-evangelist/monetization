<p>Once more into the fray: Google is cutting price on Google Compute Engine instances by about 10 percent across regions and all types.Google SVP Urs Hölzle disclosed the cuts, effective immediately, Wednesday during Atmosphere Live, but don’t expect that to be the end of it: Given past history, expect Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to react with cuts of their own.Up until this past year, Amazon pretty much unilaterally cut prices on base compute and storage services, but last March Google made its presence felt with 30 percent price cuts  and — perhaps more importantly — sustained use discounts that kick off additional discounts automatically once virtual machines hit 25 percent utilization.And sustained use discounts do not require pre-payment.Those moves persuaded even some skeptics that Google is, in fact, serious about competing head-to-head with AWS in public cloud.</p>
