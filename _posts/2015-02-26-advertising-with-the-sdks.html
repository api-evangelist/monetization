<p>The Brightcove iOS and Android Native Player SDKs offer a suite of options to help you monetize your content.The Native SDKs and their integrations enable publishers to decide how to best optimize the advertising in their player with features such as pre-, mid- and post-roll advertisements, as well as companion ads.Client-side advertising is the traditional approach of having ad requests and ad insertion performed on the client device.With this method, the main video plays back until a specific ad cue point is hit.At this point, a request is made to the configured ad server, which responds with the appropriate ad details.</p>
