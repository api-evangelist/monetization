<p>In recent days newspapers, like the New York Times, the Washington Post and USA Today, have reported that music streaming is starting to supplant downloads.According to one market research survey, streaming was up 42% through the first six months of 2014 compared to 2013, while download sales declined 12% in the same period.While music tastes and preferences are constantly evolving, amazingly what is also evolving is how we consume music─ from concerts, to records, to CD’s, to downloads, and now to streaming.Who would have guessed that distribution – not the music itself – would be the golden ticket in this industry?Consumers are notoriously fickle and streaming-delivery represents the latest “mousetrap” because it suits our consumption desires better.</p>
