<p>Looking to bolster the number of applications that run or access its business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce cloud service, Tradeshift has announced it no longer requires a 30 percent revenue share requirement from developers that build applications on its platform.Recognizing that by making it more enticing to build applications on its platform will ultimately help it compete more aggressively against rivals platforms such as the Ariba service owned by SAP, Tradeshift Chief Executive Officer Christian Lanng says the company decided to waive the revenue sharing requirement.The Tradeshift Studio development tools that Tradeshift offers developers are based on an implementation of JavaScript.Developers can use those tools to either develop applications that  run directly on the Tradeshift cloud service or access Tradeshift cloud services via RESTful APIs.Lanng says that rather than making use of arcane Web services technologies, Tradeshift designed its cloud platform to be more accessible to developers from the ground up.</p>
