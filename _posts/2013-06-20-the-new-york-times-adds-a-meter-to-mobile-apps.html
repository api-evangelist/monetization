<p>Since 2011, the Times’ web paywall and app paywall have functioned differently.The website gave nonsubscribers a maximum number of articles per month; its apps set aside a subset of top stories that were free to all, but put everything else beyond reach.The newspaper just announced it would be normalizing that divide, creating a meter for readers of the company’s mobile applications.Starting June 27, nonsubscribers will be able to read three articles per day through the app before being prompted to sign up for a subscription.After that, they’ll still get to browse headlines and article summaries.</p>
