<p>Recently, we announced the Azure App Service which is a one-of-a kind cloud service that enables developers to build intelligent web and mobile apps for any platform and any device.App Service is an integrated solution that streamlines development, enables easy integration with on-premises and SaaS systems and provides the ability to quickly automate business processes.Azure App Service also introduces a new Premium Tier bringing increased scaling, deployment and service capabilities to app developers.In this post, Iâ€™d like to spend some time drilling into the benefits that come with the Premium Tier of App Service.Premium Tier brings the power of BizTalk services to your apps, including 5,000 API calls per core per day for Premium Connectors, EAI Services, EDI Services and Rules.</p>
