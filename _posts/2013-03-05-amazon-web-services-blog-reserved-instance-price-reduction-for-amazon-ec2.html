<p>The AWS team is always exploring ways to reduce costs and to pass the savings along to our customers.Were more than happy to continue this tradition with our latest price reduction.Starting today, we are reducing prices for new EC2 Reserved Instances running Linux/UNIX, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server by up to 27%.This reduction applies to the Standard (m1), Second-Generation Standard (m3), High-Memory (m2), and High-CPU (c1) instance families.As always, if you reserve more, you will save more.</p>
