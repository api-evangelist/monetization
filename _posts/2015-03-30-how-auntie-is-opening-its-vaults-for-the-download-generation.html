<p>With consumer habits changing drastically in the digital age, media distribution has had to embrace the latest technologies to make sure it remains relevant to a one-click culture of instant gratification.Subscription-based models are constantly on the rise, and now the world’s oldest broadcaster, the BBC, is following suit, according to Chloe Green’s recent article for Information Age.The BBC iPlayer will extend its catch-up service from 7 to 30 days, after which the content will be available on a download-to-own basis.As well as new content, historical archived content will also be available after being converted to digital format for the first time.The goal is to make as much content available to as many people as possible across a wide variety of devices.</p>
