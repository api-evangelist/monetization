<p>The free offer of Azure App Service supports up to 10 free Web Apps with included storage and bandwidth.The included bandwidth had a daily quota of 165 MB per day across all Web Apps (10 Max) per region.This summed up to be 5GB of bandwidth per month per region.This quota was enforced on a daily basis and your Web Apps were suspended for the reminder of the day.You can have 1 web app (out of your max allowed 10) use up 165MB on a given day and this will result in all 10 web apps being suspended for the reminder of the day.</p>
