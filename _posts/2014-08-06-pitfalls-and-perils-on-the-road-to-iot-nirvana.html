<p>As I sat down to actually write this post I spent a chunk of time staring at an empty page and scratching my head (a risky activity for me given the steadily declining amount of hair still attached to it).What does IoT Nirvana even look like?It’s a dizzyingly broad subject.From a consumer perspective, I would broadly describe it as hands-on technology that gives me more insight into and control over the things that are important to me.I see at least five significant issues that need to be addressed along the way:
