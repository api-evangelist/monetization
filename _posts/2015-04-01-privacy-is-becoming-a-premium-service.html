<p>Cable companies have some of the worst customer service reputations around, one of the reasons why the net neutrality cause got so much support in a mostly laissez-faire age.Undaunted by the recent Federal Communications Commission decision to reclassify them as Title II utilities, which restricts their ability to make content providers pay to play for faster traffic speeds, cable companies are looking into more insidious ways to profit from owning the Internet’s pipes.Take a recent move by AT&T: spying on its customers.It’s just the latest installment of the consumer data mining sweepstakes, in which corporations are rushing to profile consumers in ways that would make the National Security Agency blush.We’re accustomed to the nickel-and-dime service charges that get tacked on to our cable bills, like irritating rental fees for modems.</p>
