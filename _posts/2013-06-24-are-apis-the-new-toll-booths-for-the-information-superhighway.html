<p>As a nation that derives most of its revenue from taxation of citizens and businesses, a new revenue stream can be created from placing tolls on the government data that flows on the information superhighway.The data flowing out of the US Govt Federal Agencies, States, and Cities is a valuable bi-product of government operations.All of that government “big data” can provide businesses, US and International, with critical information about how to optimize and improve their products and services. For example, the insurance industry can fine-tune their rates for health and auto insurance policies based on crime data, census data, and IRS data.Just as drivers pay access to use better and faster roads, data consumers (businesses or citizens alike) will pay for access to use better and faster data resources.</p>
