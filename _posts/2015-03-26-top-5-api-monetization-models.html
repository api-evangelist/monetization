<p>At Nordic APIs we live in the backend, where the Application Programming Interface (API) is king.We believe in an API’s ability to make design and development easier, and we trust in its capability to improve the end-user experience.As mobile apps and Software as a Service (SaaS) providers continue to rely heavily on APIs, it’s an ideal time to revisit how APIs can increase user retention rates, and most importantly, how APIs can boost overall revenue.This piece is a guide to doing just that.We offer you the top 5 API monetization models with the hope of helping you, as an API provider, bring value to developers and end users, and financially gain from hosting your API.</p>
