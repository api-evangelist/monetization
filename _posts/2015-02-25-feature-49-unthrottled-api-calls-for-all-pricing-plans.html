<p>Feature 49: Un-throttled API calls for all pricing plans|Backend as a Service Platform
In my post yesterday I wrote about unlimited API calls for all Backendless apps.That means your application can make as many API requests as it needs during a billing period, which is one month even if the app is on the free plan.This also means all of the calls could be spread out over time, but there may also be spikes of traffic â€“ an increase of the number concurrent transactions handled by the backend.You may often see with other mBaaS platforms that they limit your apps to XX requests/second or worse yet start charging you for increasing that XX number.</p>
