I was doing my regular monitoring, and found myself on the AlchemyAPI site.Not exactly sure how I got there, but I stumbled across their HTMLGetCombinedData API, which can be used for analysis on HTML content, and is one of 3 separate APIs, AlchemyAPI is calling combined calls.If you aren’t familiar with AlchemyAPI, the company has a number of valuable APIs, which you can use to make sense of content and data from on, or offline source.I use AlchemyAPI for API Evangelist, to pull keywords, and the content out of blog posts, helping me shed the overall look of a site, and any advertisements--getting down to the raw content.What I thought was particularly interesting about this API, was their approach combined calls, and specifically their approach to monetizing these aggregated API calls.</p>
