<p>Would you pay an extra monthly fee just to avoid seeing some online ads based on your web browsing history?That’s the premise behind a staggered-pricing option offered by AT&T’s ultrafast fiber optic network, called GigaPower, which the company introduced in the Kansas City area on Monday.For more than a year, the company has offered lower prices to GigaPower customers who are willing to participate in  AT&T Internet Preferences, an analytics program that allows the Internet service provider to use information about the sites its customers visit and the search terms they enter for the purpose of personalizing ads to them online or via email or direct mail.“For example,” AT&T explains on its site, “if you search for a car online, you may receive an email notifying you of a local dealership’s sale.”
For customers who participate in the targeted-advertising program, AT&T has “premier offer” prices for Internet speeds of up to one gigabit per second starting at $70 a month.</p>
