Wattpadders have noticed that we’ve been experimenting with some new content and features lately.If you’ve seen some of these experiments, you may have also noticed that some of the new offerings are paid, unlike the rest of Wattpad’s free content.To eliminate any doubt, we wanted to make one thing clear: these experiments do not signal a new, paid version of Wattpad.There are millions of writers on Wattpad who dedicate a lot of time and effort to writing the stories that Wattpadders read for free.Wattpad is running these experiments to find new and innovative ways to give value back to the writers, while keeping the stories that they write available for free.</p>
