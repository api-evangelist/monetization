<p>One of the key components of a data strategy is whether you charge for your API usage or not.Some API’s are more appropriate for free usage.If your API strategy is focused around breadth or indirect monetization, such as using your API to drive traffic to your website, then unpaid usage may fit your goals.For example, a retailer may publish an API to enable mobile applications and web developers to integrate product, inventory, and pricing data.Although metered to ensure appropriate usage and analytics, generally the retailer would not charge for API use in this case.</p>
