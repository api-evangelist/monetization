<p>Uber is trying to patent one of its most controversial features: surge pricing.The car-service app in September of 2013 applied to patent the way it charges customers during busy periods, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.When theres higher demand for cars, Uber charges more.Some have called this practice price-gouging, though it is not illegal to charge more for cars when demand is higher.In the most recent flare-up of controversy over the practice, many critics were upset that Uber started to use surge pricing in the part of Sydney, Australia, being evacuated during a hostage crisis last week.</p>
