<p>I read an article recently on Deconstructing your AWS cloud bill and how it is so complicated because billing is broken down by five major service types, which are compute and networking, storage and content delivery, databases, deployment and management, and application services as well as options and features.If you then consider that these can be consumed per hour, on a discounted rate based on upfront commitment, or even spot priced basis, you can see why cloud billing can get complicated and AWS is not alone.Some companies are solving these challenges such as NewVem, which helps to better optimize AWS and realize time and cost savings; Cloudability, which offers cloud cost management tools; and PlanForCloud, which enables sophisticated modeling of the components of cloud deployments.Today though I want to offer a detailed explanation of the different billing models we are seeing in the market.As service providers move to provide cloud services, all billing models have different pros and cons depending on each customer, its usage model and internal budgeting requirements.</p>
