<p>Editor’s note: Ezra Galston is a VC at I2A Fund, a young entrepreneur at Foundation Capital, a Kauffman Fellows Finalist and a second-year MBA student at Chicago Booth.He focuses on early-stage technology investments.Follow him on Twitter @EzraMoGee.It seems like nearly every tech business has sought to employ a subscription model for its services.While that makes sense from a business perspective, I wanted to investigate any effects of subscription fatigue on consumer commerce – questions such as whether a service like Dropbox might be on the chopping block if consumers’ wallets are stretched.</p>
