title: 'Building Blocks'
---
<p>These are some of the common building blocks I have pullled from my research into this layer of the API space.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0"><tr>

<h2>Acquisition</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover </strong> - What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching, and connecting the dots.
</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong> - What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Most of the time its on the Internet, and other times it requires travel, and meeting with folks.
</li>
<li><strong>Licensing </strong> - There is a chance I would license a database from a company or institution, so I want to have this option in here. Even if this is open source, I want the license referenced as part of acquisition.
</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> - Also the chance I may buy a database from someone outright, or pay them to put the database together, resulting in one-time fee, which I'm going to call "purchase".
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment</strong> - Who put up the money to support the development of this API resource? Was it internal, or did we have to take external investment.
</li>
<li><strong>Grant</strong> - Was the development of this API rolled up in a grant, or specifically a grant for its development. Covering costs involved.
</li>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong> - What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary.
</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> - What does it take me to generate a Swagger and API Blueprint, something that isn't just auto-generated, but also has the required hand polish it will require.
</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - How much work am I putting into setting up the database. A lot of this I can automate, but there is always a setup cost involved.
</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Defining the amount of work I put into setting up, and configuring the server to run a new API, including where it goes in my overall operations plan.
</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> - How much work to I put into actually coding an API. I use the Slim PHP framework, and using automation scripts I can generate 75% of it usually, but there is always finish work.
</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong> - What was the overhead in me defining, and configuring the DNS for any API, setting up endpoint domain, as well as potentially a portal to house operations. 
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is surface area for monitoring?
</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - What does it cost for me to secure a single API, as part of the larger overall operations? Does internal resource spend time, or is this a 3rd party service.
</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization</strong> - What am I spending on virtualization for an API, as part of QA process, for retail sandbox and simulation environments, or for specific partner needs.

<h2>Access Levels</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong> - This is just a free API, I won't be rate limiting the usage of it. It will act similar to any website I put out there, but instead of HTML it is JSON.
</li>
<li><strong>Free Trial</strong> - I am only going to offer a limited use, or time period for access a resource, giving just a taste test, but won't be in main pool of APIs available. 
</li>
<li><strong>Not For Profit</strong> - This API is being subsidized somehow. Either there is direct investment from internal or external resources to subsidize or there is a grant involved.
</li>
<li><strong>Educational Access</strong> - Is this API available as an educational resource, with special pricing for students and teachers? This will usually be reflected in the tier, and credit availability.
</li>
<li><strong>Tier(s)</strong> - Which of these service tiers is an API available in, and which endpoint paths + verbs are accessible in the tier (api-pricing definition).
</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - General access, you usually don't even need a key. Only limited to specific APIs.
</li>
<li><strong>Retail</strong> - This is the pay as you go level for public acess to all APIs. This is where the retail side of business operations will occur.
</li>
<li><strong>Trusted</strong> - These are just a handful of trusted individuals or companies, who may have write access to some endpoints.
</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - These are partners I have prearranged agreements with, something I will be transparent about, showcasing them on partner page.
</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale</strong> - The wholesale, often non-rate limited portion of my platform, where I deploy APIs in other people infrastructure, or our own for flat fees.
</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong> - This is all internal access by applications I build for my own usage. I still rate limit, and manage this access, I just give myself different privileges.
</li>
<li><strong>Partner Program</strong> - A structured program allowing API consumers to achieve higher levels of access, with reduced pricing levels, flat rate access, and other benefits.
</li>
<li><strong>Reseller Program</strong> - A structured programming for allowing API consumers to prove themselves, and share in revenues from API usage, affiliate links, and revenue share.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pricing & Credits</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Value of Resources</strong> - What is the value of an API resource? Often you will be just making this up, but at the least you should be able to articulate in some way.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - What revenue opportunities for the ecosystem around an API and its operation, sharing in the money made from platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>API Value</strong> - Each API will have its own credit rate set, where some will be one credit, while others may be 100 credits to make a single call, it can be defined by API or a specific endpoint.
</li>
<li><strong>Daily Limit</strong> - The daily allowed credit limit will be determined by the access level tier is registered at, starting with daily free public access to retail, trusted, and potentially custom tiers.
</li>
<li><strong>Usage</strong> - How many credits does any one user use during a day, week, or month, across all APIs. When each API is used, it will apply the defined credit value for the single API call.
</li>
<li><strong>Incentive</strong> - How can the platform give credits as an incentive for use, or even pay credits for writing to certain APIs, and enriching the system, or driving traffic.
</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> - What does it cost to buy a credit, something that could fluctuate from day to day, week to week, or month to month.
</li>
<li><strong>Buyout</strong> - Allow API consumers to get paid for the credits on their account, preferably all users are encouraged to spend credits, but buyout is an option.
</li>
<li><strong>Discounts</strong> - Can we give discounts when you buy credits through specific channels, promotions, or other type of planned deal.
</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong> - Are there volume discounts for buying of credits, allowing consumers to purchase credits in bulk, when they need to and apply when they desire. 
</li>
<li><strong>Applying</strong> - Can you wait to apply credits you have accumulated? Given the option with each billing cycle to apply, or you may want to wait and use at future date.

<h2>Indirect Value Generation</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle</strong> - Having an API is cool these days, and some APIs are worth just having for the PR value, and extending the overall brand of the platform.
</li>
<li><strong>Web or Mobile Traffic</strong> - The API exists solely for distributing links to web and mobile applications, driving traffic to specific properties - is this tracked as part of other analytics?
</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness</strong> - Applying a brand strategy, and using the API to incentivize publishers to extend the reach of the brand and ultimately the platform - can we quantify this?
</li>
<li><strong>Data & Content Acquisition</strong> - Using the API, and the applications built on top as part of a larger data and content acquisition strategy--can we quantify this?
</li>
