<h2>Acquisition</h2>
</td>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover </strong> - What did I spent to find this. I may have had to buy someone dinner or beer to find, as well as time on the Internet searching, and connecting the dots.
</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong> - What time to I have in actually getting access to something. Most of the time its on the Internet, and other times it requires travel, and meeting with folks.
</li>
<li><strong>Licensing </strong> - There is a chance I would license a database from a company or institution, so I want to have this option in here. Even if this is open source, I want the license referenced as part of acquisition.
</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> - Also the chance I may buy a database from someone outright, or pay them to put the database together, resulting in one-time fee, which I'm going to call "purchase".
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Grant</strong> - Was the development of this API rolled up in a grant, or specifically a grant for its development. Covering costs involved.
</li>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong> - What does it take me to cleanup, and normalize a dataset, or across content. This is usually he busy janitorial work necessary.
</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> - What does it take me to generate a Swagger and API Blueprint, something that isn't just auto-generated, but also has the required hand polish it will require.
</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - How much work am I putting into setting up the database. A lot of this I can automate, but there is always a setup cost involved.
</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - Defining the amount of work I put into setting up, and configuring the server to run a new API, including where it goes in my overall operations plan.
</li>

<h2>Direct Value</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>API Value</strong> - Each API will have its own credit rate set, where some will be one credit, while others may be 100 credits to make a single call, it can be defined by API or a specific endpoint.
</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong> - The daily allowed credit limit will be determined by the access level tier is registered at, starting with daily free public access to retail, trusted, and potentially custom tiers.
</li>
<li><strong>Usage</strong> - How many credits does any one user use during a day, week, or month, across all APIs. When each API is used, it will apply the defined credit value for the single API call.
</li>
<li><strong>Incentive</strong> - How can the platform give credits as an incentive for use, or even pay credits for writing to certain APIs, and enriching the system, or driving traffic.
</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> - What does it cost to buy a credit, something that could fluctuate from day to day, week to week, or month to month.
</li>
<li><strong>Buyout</strong> - Allow API consumers to get paid for the credits on their account, preferably all users are encouraged to spend credits, but buyout is an option.
</li>
<li><strong>Discounts</strong> - Can we give discounts when you buy credits through specific channels, promotions, or other type of planned deal.
</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong> - Are there volume discounts for buying of credits, allowing consumers to purchase credits in bulk, when they need to and apply when they desire. 
</li>
<li><strong>Applying</strong> - Can you wait to apply credits you have accumulated? Given the option with each billing cycle to apply, or you may want to wait and use at future date.
</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> - What is the value of an API resource? Often you will be just making this up, but at the least you should be able to articulate in some way.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - What revenue opportunities for the ecosystem around an API and its operation, sharing in the money made from platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Timeframes</strong> - What timeframes can be leverage to generate direct value? Timeframes should be used in conjunction with plans to dial in the value generated.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong> - What are the metrics, no matter what you choose to track by, what is the metric and its value? The most common metrics is the hit, but could be any other quantifiable metric you can consider.</li>
<li><strong>Geo</strong> - How can geographic location be leverage as part of determining value generation? Different data centers, or networks, or possibly as part of support. How can geographic constraints be applied to maximize value generated.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - The best part of API design, is you can dial in your value generate to the smallest unit of compute, the single API resource. How are APIs value generation considered at the individual level like this? </li>
<li><strong>Extensions</strong> - Are there extensions available that will impact the developers, or end-users experience. Can extensions be used for a default experience, or added on to incrementally increase value generated.</li>
<li><strong>Usage</strong> - How is usage wielded as part of value generation? Is value about the increased usage of a resource, or possible value generated by a minimum usage of a resource? Usage is an important dimension of determining how value is generated as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Fees</strong> - How are fees leveraged as part of value generation, where like usage, fees driving that value generation, or possibly the lack of fees is where the value lies.  Where, within the ecosystem do discussing fees make sense?</li>
<li><strong>Donations</strong> - Does API operations depend on donations, either one time, or possibly soliciting ongoing donations to make sure an API operations. An actual API may be present to allow for donations to occur in-line.</li>
<li><strong>Grants</strong> - Is the value generated around API operations because of a single, or possibly multiple grants? How are grant programs leveraged to develop the API itself, or possibly drive the evolution of resources made available via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Percentages</strong> - Is value generation measured in percentages? Such as revenue share, or percentage of any resource usage for free. There are a number of ways to think about percentages, and how they apply to defining value generation.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - How is value generated on a per user level? More users is valuable, or possible fewer users. Teams, groups, and many other ways to determine how users impact positively or negatively the value generated from platform usage.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> - How can relationships between users, or companies be applied to value generated? Will access to more relationships positively or negatively impact how value is generated for platform, and consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - Is access to support something that impacts the value being generated? Does access to support resources introduce the optimal levels of value consumers are looking for? How is support wielded within overall platform monetization.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Is value generated looked at on a per application basis? Does having multiple applications impact the value generate? Coming up with interesting ways to understand how applications impact platform value for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Integrations</strong> - What external integrations are available? How can these be leveraged to enhance the value for consumers? Are some integrations part of base operations, where others are accessible at higher levels, or on a one off basis.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong> - Similar to donations, what investment possibilities are part of platform operations? How can access to invest be a value option for consumers, and be used to create more value for platform operators? </li>
